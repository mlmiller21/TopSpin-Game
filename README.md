# Top-Spin

The premise of the game is to reorder the cirular chain of numbers, which are created using a linked list.
The list can be shifted left and right, and the numbers within the box can be "spun" (reversed).
Once the numbers are all ordered in incrementing value, the game is won. 
A list data structure was created for the project, rather than including the list library available in c++
